    Hi, there....

    I have now found out how to make .exe files run from a cd. (many of you already know
    this, but certainly didn't try to help people asking for this information!).
    So, I had analyse the psx .exe files!

    Ok, the way to do this is:

    1) Make sure the .exe file you want put onto cd is run through eco2exe and combine2
    (if it needs .dat files and/or the pslibs)

    2) Take a look at the file size. It must be dividable by 2048 bytes, if not use a
    program like HexWorkshop/Ultraedit to add a number zeroised bytes at the end of the
    file, so that it's dividable with 2048 (giving an exact number!)

    3) Take the new filesize and substract 2048 from it (filesize-2048). Hexedit the new
    .exe file and goto offset 30 and write highest byte to it, then write the next byte to
    offset 29.

    4) Burn the file to a CD, (remember to edit .. system.cnf... whatever!) Enjoy, the
    COOL psxdemo or game you just burned!!!

    Upz! I will code a little utility to automaticly do this little trick in the near future.
