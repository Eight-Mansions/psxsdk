'Where's the problem ?' i hear you say. Well, it's pretty simple: if you just
build a normal ISO file, burn the CD and insert it into the modified PSX
you will experience something rather strange: Instead of the normal black
screen with a 4-color PSX logo and the 'Licensed by .....' statement
you will get a black screen, sometimes a wrecked blue SONY logo, and in 90%
of the cases the PSX crashes after that.It actually appears because of a 
graphics information lack, caused by missing data in sectors 0-11.           
This tool adds the appropriate information, thus creating a 100% working disc.

Apparantly you now also got to know (one of the few reasons atleast) why a
single file-copy of a PSX disc NEVER worked properly without pre-booting
with a working one.

Anyway, here we go: 

Step 1: Edit a SYSTEM.CNF that fits your purposes: 

BOOT = cdrom:\MYINTRO.EXE;1
TCB = 4
EVENT = 10
STACK = 801FFFF0

Step 2: Build an ISO image, containing your EXE file and the SYSTEM.CNF
        Make sure you select CDROM-XA and MODE2 ! This tool expects 2352 
        bytes/sector ! We used EZCD pro 95 btw. :)
        
Step 3: Use this tool to 'license' the ISO image you built.

Step 4: Burn the CD

Step 5: Put in inside your modified PSX, reset and enjoy !!


YAROZE COMPILER USERS READ THIS:

Yaroze exe files in ECOFF format cannot be burned directly. The procedure is
quite hard, but it's possible. The problem is that you have to have LIBPS.EXE
loaded, even when you convert your ECOFF file with our ECO2EXE tool.  
So you would have to link your exe and the LIBPSX.EXE together and adjust
the filelength in the header or the LIBPS.EXE file to get it 100% working.
I experienced problems with the only available tool for that at the moment;
i will try to contact the author or write one myself as soon as possible.
If you have better experience with the above mentioned tool, let me know asap.


DISCLAIMER:
                
In NO FUCKING WAY we are responsible for:

-  any copyright violations that appear after using this tool. It has been
   created for the ONLY purpose that the sceners can burn their own, working
   CD's to take them to neighbours, friends, whatever to show their piece of
   PSX art. If someone thinks it's useful to link intros infront of cracked 
   games or insert trainer, levelskip or whatever to a game that still works
   after beeing filecopied (Games without .STR/.STX movies and no multiple
   audio tracks, e.g. track01 does also appear as DATA like track01.raw
   or track01.pcm), it's their own fucking problem. In no way we mean to 
   support people that support game piracy, trade PSX CD images, and harm
   SONY COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT (TM) in any other way. 

-  any frisbees you get out of your CD toaster because you are to stupid to
   read the instructions closely. We tested the program, and on OUR equipment
   it worked perfectly without problems.

-  Copyright problems arising out of the use of the license file. The license
   file that this tool uses is in no way taken from any officially released
   game or production. It doesnt even say that it's licensed by the big S,
   so what the fuck ?!
