Purpose
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program was written to help Yaroze users out who wish to use the Game
Shark (aka Action Replay) and its link card with their EXE files, and to help
people put Yaroze programs more easily onto a CD.

ECO2EXE was written a while back by Silpheed of HITMEN.  This was probably
THE best program written to help Yaroze users.  It converts ECOFF (Yaroze)
programs into the special, more usable PS-X EXE format.  This allowed Yaroze
users to run via Game Shark, but it still didn't help much in the area of CD
burning, and it required that you load LIBPS.EXE and various other files
separately which got to be a pain.

That's why I wrote COMBINE.  It is a simple program that combines (you KNEW
it had something to do with combination) a Yaroze ECOFF file, LIBPS.EXE, and
the files loaded into RAM by the SIOCONS script.  In all, it's really an
SIOCONS script -> PS-X EXE converter.


What you need
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
LIBPS.EXE
ECO2EXE.EXE (if you wish to modify COMBINE's source)
An SIOCONS script
A Yaroze ECOFF format file, or an eco2exe -p converted EXE file
The data files used by the SIOCONS script

That's all.


Building an SIOCONS script
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SIOCONS is similar to the command format used by batch files that load files
into RAM via caetla/ezoray.  For those who use ezoray/caetla for Yaroze
development (who may not know SIOCONS scripting), I have provided the
following command translations.  I can't teach you what these mean, and
anyone who'd need this information is a programmer.

EZ-O-Ray                    SIOCONS
ez load ASDF.BIN 12345678   local dload ASDF.BIN 12345678
ez run ASDF.PSX             local load ASDF.PSX
                            go

caetla                      SIOCONS
psexe -D12345678 ASDF.BIN   local dload ASDF.BIN 12345678
psexe -X ASDF.PSX           local load ASDF.PSX
psexe ASDF.PSX              local load ASDF.PSX
                            go


Running COMBINE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's pretty simple.  This is the syntax:

COMBINE <scriptfile> <exefile> <libps location> <eco2exe location>

scriptfile:       SIOCONS script to use (most programs call it AUTO)
exefile:          PS-X EXE file to generate.
libps location:   Path + filename of LIBPS.EXE (not needed if LIBPS.PSX is
                  in current directory)
eco2exe location: Path + filename of ECO2EXE.EXE (not needed except in
                  versions of COMBINE that don't have ECO2EXE internally,
                  and not needed if ECO2EXE.EXE is in current directory)


Mini-FAQ
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How do I burn to CD?
A. This is a pretty complicated procedure, and I don't wish to explain it
   here.  Once you learn how, it is quite easy though.

Q. How do I run a COMBINE-generated EXE file?
A. Use the appropriate load and run command of your GS/AR ROM replacement.

Q. Where do I get LIBPS.EXE?
A. For non-Yaroze users, this file is illegal and therefore hard to find.  To
   get it the "legit" way (or illegit if you have the CD illegally) is to
   stick the Yaroze BOOT (NOT development) CD into your PC's CD-ROM and copy
   it to hard drive.

Q. Why are my executable so damn big?
A. The primary problem is the format of the PS-X EXE files.  The PS-X EXE
   format only allows for linear mapping.  With Yaroze, you send data files
   directly into RAM below the EXE.  The problem with this is that Yaroze
   programmers tend to leave space in the memory space where these subfiles
   are.  Empty space such as this is copied into the COMBINE-generated EXE
   file.  In addition, programmers usually use a very high ORG address such
   as 80100000 for their Yaroze programs even if they don't need to at all.
   With an ORG address like that, the EXE file is destined to be at least 1
   meg, and probably more.  The last but significant factor is the size of
   LIBPS.EXE.

   To reduce the size of the EXE, change the addresses of the data files to
   be as closely packed as possible, start "user memory" at the lowest
   address possible in Yaroze (80071000), and set a lower ORG address for the
   program (the -Xlinker option is what controls it).
