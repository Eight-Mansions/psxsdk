Overview:

The following tools have been created to help PC users contruct sound files
more easily for the PlayStation. Most of the current sound tools are geared
towards Mac users which can cause problems for developers without access to
an Apple Mac computer.

So far I have only written tools for VAB/VAG format but I hope to also pro-
duce tools to handle SEQ and SEP files in the near future.

Tools:

1. Wav2Vag - This is a simple program which stips off the header from
             Windows format '.wav' files and then shells the Aiff2Vag
             program with the correct options. It requires 16bit mono
             wav files. It runs as a DOS program with command line
             parameters.

2. VABTool - This is a windows program to contruct/edit VAB files

             a) You can edit/add programs and tones.
             b) You can set ADSR settings for tones.
             c) You can add VAG format files to the sound data section
                of the VAB file.
             d) You can edit '.VH' format VAB Headers
             
3. Vag_Play - This is a windows program that allows you to preview programs
              in a VAB file on the PC using a standard 16bit PC sound card.

              a) You can play notes by clicking on a 'keyboard' image.
              b) It supports playback of multiple tones mapped to one note.
              c) It previews panning, volume and tone settings for note.                                                                                
              d) Notes can be looped for continuous playback
              e) This program when used with VABTool provides a means of
                 modifying and previewing VAB's on the PC.

Instructions/Notes:

1. This is the very first version so I fully expect there to be few bugs, so
   be carefull! You have been warned.

2. Wav2Vag may not work with some of the newer format 'wav' files if they use
   non standard format.

3. You will need your screen set to at least 800x600 to view the dialogs on
   VABTool and Vag_Play.

4. You can double click the grids on VABTool to access other dialogs more
   quickly.

5. Vag_Play only represents an approximation of the sound output on the PSX
   in particular features such as reverb and ADSR are ignored.

6. You will need to set the path for 'Vag_Play.exe' to use it with VABTool
   there is an option on the tools menu for VABTool to do this.

7. When previewing files with Vag_Play via VABTool remember to close Vag_Play
   and restart it if you make a change.

8. To use Vag_Play on it's own you must launch it with a command line which
   is the filename (including path) of the VAB file you wish to play.

9. There's some pretty intensive processing going on to decode the VAG sound
   data and modify sampling rates etc, so you may find this needs a fast
   PC. I'll be interested to get feedback on this.

Comming Soon:

1. I am hoping to write a SEP and SEQ tool to go with this tool.
2. Extra facilities for VAB Tool I would like to add are:
        a) Fully integrating the preview tool into VABTool
        b) Improving the dialogs possibly with a graphical view of tones
        c) Adding a '.VB' import routine to reconstruct VAB files from
           the '.VH' and '.VB' files
        d) Supporting preview on PSX cards in some form or other.

Support/Fixes:

Please email me with any comments, requests or suggestions I'll be happy to
hear some feedback.
