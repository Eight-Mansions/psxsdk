This plugin is provided with the Net Yaroze development system
to allow users to save out RSD files from 3D Studio Rel 4.
The tool is unsupported and includes features which are used
in the profession development environment.  The Animation 
capabilities of the Plugin are active, but are not supported 
by Net Yaroze.

FUNCTION
========
This program is a plug-in program for the Autodesk 3D Studio (3DS).

With this  plug-in, you can save 3DS object or animation data in PlayStation
format (RST ,TOD) while using 3DS.


REQUIREMENT
===========
This plug-in runs only on 3DS R4. 

FILES
=====
This plug-in kit contains following files.

    3dstod.txt    ... Document in English 
    tod_i.kxp     ... Plug-in module.
    tod.ini       ... Configuration file sample.

INSTALLATION
============
1) Copy plug-in module "tod_i.kxp" to the "process" directory in the 3DS home
directory.

If you have installed your 3DS into "c:\3ds4", then you have to copy
"tod_i.kxp" to "c:\3ds4\process" directory.


2) Copy configuration file "tod.ini" into 3DS home directory.

3) Make sure the directories specified in your TOD.ini exist.


How to start
============
1) In the KeyFramer of 3DS, press "F12" key.

2) Select "TOD" from KXP plug-in list.


FUNCTIONS
=========
scale:
------
Scales size of object size and translation of object/camera. 

For instance, if you set scale value to 10.0, then the object size and
translation of object and camera is expanded 10 times.

You can specify the scale value to control the object size. Also, you use
this value to get rid of the near-clip, far-clip and z-sort problems, which
will occur on PS.

Load obj:
---------
Loads new 3DS file without exiting from TOD plug-in.


Save RSD:
---------
Object data is saved as RSD file.
Each object is saved as different RSD file.

System will ask "Generate File name automatically?".

If you choose "Yes", system asks you a base name which will be used to
generate new file names. System adds hexadecimal 3 digit to the end of the
base name. Therefore only first five letters are used as base name.

For instance, if you give "c:\psxgraph\data\rsd\mydata.rsd" as the
base name, following RSD files will be generated automatically.

	c:\psx\3ds\mydat000.rsd
		   mydat001.rsd
		   mydat002.rsd
	   		  ...
		   mydat00e.rsd
		   mydat00f.rsd
		   mydat010.rsd
			  ...                             
		   mydatfff.rsd


The object names used in 3DS cannot be used as RSD files, because it can
be longer than 8 letters.

TOD plug-in also generates PRJ file (in the case above,"mydata.prj").
Correspondence between object name and RSD file is specified in the project
file.


If you choose "No", you have to give all the RSD file names.

You had better choose "Yes", except when you have to specify the file
names by yourself.

[Material]
- 3DS material should be set as follows in order to generate Gouraud polygon
in RSD file.

   1) polygon is either, Gouraud, Phong, or meta.
   2) at lease one of it edge is smooth.
      which means that, it has at least same smoothing group with at lease
      one its adjacent polygons.

- "Diffuse color" in 3DS is converted into polygon color in RSD.

- "Non 0 transparency value" in 3DS is converted into semi-transparent
polygon in RSD.

- Texture maps

   1) Only the "texture 1" is converted to RSD.

   2) Texture more than 256x256 can not correctly converted to RSD.

   3) Tiling information is ignored.

   4) Face map can be converted to RSD.

- Any other 3DS material information is ignored.


[!]
Each object is save as RSD format in local coordinate. The difference of each
object from the origin of world coordinate is saved in TOD file. For
instance, if you have created human body which consists of number of parts,
and saved each parts as different RSD file, those RSD file objects does not
represent the location of each part in the body. In order to take account in
the location of each object, you can follow following method,

 1) On PlayStation, specify each object's coordinate referring the TOD data.

 2) On 3DS attach all the parts in one object.

TOD previewer is using the first method. Second method is valid only when
each part of the body does not change the location each other.

LIMITATIONS
===========
1) Morphing data is not converted.

2) Information on lights is not converted.

3) Pivot:

3DS's pivot is interpreted as translation and transformation in TOD data.
Therefor as far as you play the TOD data on PS, the animation on 3DS is
correctly reproduced on PS. But, the data of "pivot" itself is not converted
to TOD data. So you cannot animate an object according to its pivot from
your program. For instance, if you place a pivot of a robot's arm to its
shoulder point, and if you try to rotate the arm around the shoulder point,
the arm will rotate around its local axis, not around the shoulder point.

You can use "dummy object" instead of pivot, to change the rotation axis.

4) Link information:

In 3DS, you can specify whether to propagate the rotation and scaling
information from the parent object to the child object or not. On the other
hand, PlayStation's library (libgs) always propagate those information from
the parent to the child. Therefore, if you specify not to propagate any of
those information on 3DS, the resultant TOD will not reproduce the same
effect. To avoid those problems, you should not stop propagating the
information from the parent to the child.

5) Scaling:

If the scale value exceed 8.0 on 3DS, it will not apply properly on
PlayStation. It is because, PlayStation uses fix-point for the scale value.
"8.0" is the maximum scaling value expressed in fix-point (4096 * 8).
Notice that, in hierarchyly linked object, scale values are multiplied from
all thorough it ancestors. So the scale value could exceed 8.0 even if its
local scale is less than 8.0.
