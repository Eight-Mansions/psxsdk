# SETUP
1. Update psxsdk\bin\PSYQ.INI with the path to the psxsdk folder.
2. Add an environment variable called PSYQ_PATH and set the value to the path to the bin folder (i.e. D:\psxsdk\bin) and also add the path to the bin folder to your PATH variable.
    To get to the environment variables in windows just search for Environment in the Windows search bar and it'll come up. Then click on the Environment Variables... button.  When the comes up click the bottom New... button to add it to the System Variables. And then click on the PATH variable and then edit to add an additional path to your PATH variable (you can modify the local one at top or the global one at the bottom).

Thats it!  Enjoy!
